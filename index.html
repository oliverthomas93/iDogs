                <h2><span>Husky:   </span> The most majestic boi in all the land?</h2>
                <p>Monet's Garden was an Irish racehorse. Born in April 1998, he was a winner in 17 of his 32 starts, being placed second four times and third on two other occasions, earning £683,265 total prize money. The grey gelding was owned by David Wesley Yates and trained by Nicky Richards; he was bred by William Delahunty.[1] Although Monet's Garden was a winner of big races at Ascot and Huntingdon, he was perhaps best known for his wins at Aintree: Of his 32 career starts, 9 of them were at Aintree, producing 5 wins.

                    Monet's Garden would next appear at Aintree for the 2007 renewal of the Grade 1 Melling Chase, when he recorded a sound victory over Taranis and Well Chief.[citation needed] His next start at Aintree was also a winning one on his 2007-08 National Hunt Season reappearance in the Grade 2 Old Roan Chase. He beat the then Gold Cup hero Kauto Star, although the latter was conceding weight all-round to his three rivals on his reappearance.
                    
                    Monet's Garden had a good record at Ascot, winning twice and finishing second out of four starts.<br><br> He also won the Ascot Hurdle when it was staged at Windsor in November 2004, with Ascot being closed for rebuilding at the time- beating Monkerhostin by a clear 4 lengths.[2] His first win at Ascot was achieved in great fashion in the Ascot Chase of 2007, when beating Thisthatandtother, River City, Fota Island and Central House.
                    
                    His next start at Ascot would be in the 2008 renewal of the Ascot Chase, although this time Kauto Star convincingly extracted his revenge for his Old Roan defeat earlier that Season. He would be well beaten again when contesting the Amlin 1965 Grade 2 Chase in November 2009, although Monet's Garden rolled back the years in his final start at Ascot in the Ascot Chase of 2010- beating subsequent Ryanair and Melling Chase victor Alberta's Run by a length and a half.
                    
                    Monet's Garden won the 2008 Totesport Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon, narrowly beating 2008 Betfair Chase winner Snoopy Loopy by a half length.[citation needed] Monet's Garden returned lame after his win in the 2010 Old Roan Chase and missed his intended target of competing in the 2010 Peterborough Chase. He had sustained an abscess on his foot and was hoped to be aimed at another tilt at the 2011 Ascot Chase.</p>
